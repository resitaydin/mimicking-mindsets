# Mimicking Mindsets: AI-Driven Insights from Influential Minds

## Description
This project leverages **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** to replicate the thought processes and insights of influential individuals. By integrating advanced AI models with a curated knowledge base, it provides contextually rich responses based on the philosophies and perspectives of figures like **Prof. Dr. Erol Güngör**. The system enables users to engage with AI-generated answers that reflect the mindset of these thought leaders, offering valuable insights in fields such as social psychology, culture, and history.

## Features
- **AI-Generated Responses**: Get insights from influential minds based on their works and philosophies.
- **Confidence Scoring**: Each response is accompanied by a confidence score indicating how reliable the answer is based on the system's analysis.
- **Source Display**: View the sources and documents that contributed to the generated answer.

## Technologies Used
- **Streamlit**: For the interactive web interface.
- **Langchain**: For retrieval-augmented generation (RAG).
- **Hugging Face Models**: For embeddings and language generation.
- **FAISS**: For efficient similarity search.
